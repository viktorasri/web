    "title":"Facebook at Work to take on LinkedIn and Google Drive – today's Open Thread",

    "text":"Have your say on the social network’s move into business, Spotify’s Uber deal, Google’s Project Tango and more.Facebook may control the social graph of 1.3 billion people, but now it has ambitions to stretch deeper into the workplace, according to the Financial Times’ report on plans for “Facebook at Work”. This isn’t about getting around corporate firewalls to ensure you can see which Frozen character your friends are, though. It’s a proper move to compete with services from Google Drive and LinkedIn to Slack, and become a serious working tool. “The Silicon Valley company is developing a new product designed to allow users to chat with colleagues, connect with professional contacts and collaborate over documents,” claimed the FT. “The new site will look very much like Facebook – with a newsfeed and groups – but will allow users to keep their personal profile with its holiday photos, political rants and silly videos separate from their work identity. ”It might be a sensible move for Facebook, but how will workers (and bosses) feel about their data being shared and stored on the social network? Workplace collaboration in the cloud isn’t an alien concept for many businesses now, but I wonder how Facebook providing this will be received. What do you think?

    "title":"Uber clarifies data privacy policy as controversy rumbles – today's Open Thread",
    "date":"15 Dec 2017",
    "author":"John Smith",
    "text":"The story that broke earlier in the week about an Uber executive threatening to investigate critical journalists’ private lives rumbles on, with the company providing a couple of official responses yesterday. First, chief executive Travis Kalanick went on a tweetstorm with 13 tweets addressing the issue, although while it concluded with a direct apology to Sarah Lacy, the journalist targeted in the original comments, as Valleywag points out, there were several questions he didn’t answer. As time has gone by, journalists have been focusing on another aspect of the original BuzzFeed report that kicked off this debate – the claim that an Uber exec had “accessed the profile of a BuzzFeed News reporter, Johana Bhuiyan, to make points in the course of a discussion of Uber policies” without their permission. Uber has now published a blog post which it says aims to “make very clear our policy on data privacy, which is fundamental to our commitment to both riders and drivers”. It refers to a “strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver’s data” except for “legitimate business purposes”. Technology journalists are, unsurprisingly, questioning whether Uber’s radar for what constitutes “legitimate business” has been malfunctioning for some time. But how are you feeling about Uber and other companies of its type, in regards to privacy? Do you worry about the way your data fits into the “sharing economy”, or do the benefits of services like Uber and Airbnb trump any concerns that your records will be used against you in the future? Is this a specific issue between journalists and Uber, or is this controversy going to put non-hacks off using the company too? The comments section is open for your thoughts.",

    "title":"Off the Beaten Path in Italy — A Tour by Vespa!",
    "date":"5th Nov 2017",
    "author":"lorem ipsum",
    "text":"One of my favorite travel movie scenes of all time is in The Talented Mr. Ripley when Matt Damon and Jude Law tear around a corner on a Vespa, surrounded by the gorgeous countryside, laughing and enjoying a moment of pure happiness. I wonder how many trips to Italy were booked because of that film. (Also, Jude Law is more handsome in The Talented Mr. Ripley than any other human has been, ever.) A lot of people have watched that Vespa scene — or, more recently, Dev and Arnold riding through Tuscany in the latest season of Master of None — and dreamed of doing the same thing themselves. “Someday I’ll go to Italy and explore on a Vespa of my own.” This is truly off the beaten path in Italy. Rather than struggling through sweaty crowds in the most popular cities, you’ll be out on the open road, riding past olive groves and ancient hill towns. When I first heard of this tour company, I thought it was an awesome idea. Italy is one of the countries that I know best, but I’ve never even ridden a Vespa in the country! I would love to do a trip like this.",
